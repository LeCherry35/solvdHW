Task 1: Implement `promiseAll` Function
Your task is to implement a function called `promiseAll` that mimics the behavior of `Promise.all()`. The function should accept an array of promises and return a single promise that resolves to an array of resolved values or rejects with the reason of the first rejected promise.

Task 2: Implement `promiseAllSettled` Function
Your task is to implement a function called `promiseAllSettled` that mimics the behavior of `Promise.allSettled()`. The function should accept an array of promises and return a promise that resolves to an array of objects representing the settlement of each promise.


Task 3: Implement Chaining of Promises as a Separate Function
Your task is to implement a function called `chainPromises` that facilitates chaining of promises. The function should accept an array of functions that return promises and execute them sequentially.

Task 4: Implement `promisify` Function
Your task is to implement a function called `promisify` that converts a callback-style function into a function that returns a promise.
