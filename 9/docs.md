## Classes

### Stack <a name = "stack"></a>

A stack is a collection of elements with two principal operations: push (add an element to the top) and pop (remove the top element). It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

**Constructor:**

```
new Stack()
```

Initializes an empty stack.

**Methods:**

- `push(element)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack. Time Complexity: O(1)
- `pop()`: Removes and returns the top element from the stack. Returns null if the stack is empty. Time Complexity: O(1)
- `peek()`: Returns the top element without removing it. Returns null if the stack is empty. Time Complexity: O(1)

### MinMaxStack

Extends a basic stack to allow constant time retrieval of the minimum and maximum values.

**Constructor:**

```
new MinMaxStack()
```

Initializes an empty MinMaxStack.

**Methods:**

- `push(element)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack and updates the min and max stacks. Time Complexity: O(1)
- `pop()`: Removes and returns the top element from the stack and updates the min and max stacks. Returns "Underflow" if the stack is empty. Time Complexity: O(1)
- `getMin()`: Returns the minimum element in the stack. Returns "No elements in Stack" if the stack is empty. Time Complexity: O(1)
- `getMax()`: Returns the maximum element in the stack. Returns "No elements in Stack" if the stack is empty. Time Complexity: O(1)

## Queue <a name = "queue"></a>

A queue is a collection of elements that supports two principal operations: enqueue (add an element to the end) and dequeue (remove the first element). It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

**Constructor:**

```
new Queue()
```

Initializes an empty queue.

**Methods:**

- `enqueue(element)`: Adds an element to the end of the queue. Time Complexity: O(1)
- `dequeue()`: Removes and returns the first element of the queue. Returns null if the queue is empty. Time Complexity: O(n) due to the shift operation on the array
- `peek()`: Returns the first element without removing it. Returns null if the queue is empty. Time Complexity: O(1)

## BinaryTree <a name = "bintree"></a>

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

**Constructor:**

```
new BinaryTree()
```

Initializes an empty binary tree.

**Methods:**

- `insert(value)`: Inserts a value into the binary tree. Time Complexity: O(n)
- `search(value)`: Searches for a value in the binary tree. Returns true if the value is found, false otherwise. Time Complexity: O(n)
-Start from the root and compare the value with the current node.
-Traverse left or right based on the comparison.
- `inOrderTraversal(node)`: Performs in-order traversal of the binary tree. Time Complexity: O(n)
-Traverse the left subtree.
-Visit the node.
-Traverse the right subtree.
- `preOrderTraversal(node)`: Performs pre-order traversal of the binary tree. Time Complexity: O(n)
-Visit the node.
-Traverse the left subtree.
-Traverse the right subtree.
- `postOrderTraversal(node)`: Performs post-order traversal of the binary tree. Time Complexity: O(n)
-Traverse the left subtree.
-Traverse the right subtree.
-Visit the node.
- `isBST()`: Checks if the binary tree is a binary search tree (BST).Uses an in-order traversal to check if the nodes are in ascending order.Time Complexity: O(n)

## Graph <a name = "graph"></a>

A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes. It can represent various systems like social networks, transportation networks, etc.

**Constructor:**

```
new Graph()
```

Initializes an empty graph.

**Methods:**

- `addVertex(vertex)`: Adds a vertex to the graph. Time Complexity: O(1)
- `addEdge(vertex1, vertex2)`: Adds an edge between two vertices in the graph. Time Complexity: O(1)
- `depthFirstSearch(start)`: Performs depth-first search (DFS) starting from a given vertex.Use recursion to explore as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
- `breadthFirstSearch(start)`: Performs breadth-first search (BFS) starting from a given vertex.Use a queue to explore the neighbor nodes level by level. Time Complexity: O(V + E)
- `findShortestPathBFS(start, end)`: Finds the shortest path between two vertices using BFS. Returns the path as an array of vertices or null if no path is found. Time Complexity: O(V + E)
- `findShortestPathDijkstra(start, end)`: Finds the shortest path between two vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm. Returns the path as an array of vertices or null if no path is found. Uses a priority queue to explore the shortest path in a weighted graph.
Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V)

## LinkedList <a name = "linkedlist"></a>

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each containing a value and a reference to the next node. It allows efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

**Constructor:**

```
new LinkedList()
```

Initializes an empty linked list.
**Methods:**

- `insert(value)`: Inserts a value at the end of the linked list. Time Complexity: O(n)
- `delete(value)`: Deletes the first occurrence of a value in the linked list. Time Complexity: O(n)
- `search(value)`: Searches for a value in the linked list. Returns true if the value is found, false otherwise. Time Complexity: O(n)
- `hasCycle()`: Detects if the linked list has a cycle. Returns true if a cycle is detected, false otherwise.Use Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare). Time Complexity: O(n)

### Example Usage

```
// Create a new MinMaxStack
const minMaxStack = new MinMaxStack();
minMaxStack.push(3);
minMaxStack.push(5);
console.log(minMaxStack.getMin()); // Output: 3
console.log(minMaxStack.getMax()); // Output: 5

// Create a new Queue
const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue(1);
queue.enqueue(2);
console.log(queue.dequeue()); // Output: 1
console.log(queue.peek()); // Output: 2

// Create a new BinaryTree
const binaryTree = new BinaryTree();
binaryTree.insert(10);
binaryTree.insert(5);
binaryTree.insert(15);
console.log(binaryTree.search(5)); // Output: true

// Create a new Graph
const graph = new Graph();
graph.addVertex('A');
graph.addVertex('B');
graph.addEdge('A', 'B');
graph.depthFirstSearch('A'); // Output: A B

// Create a new LinkedList
const linkedList = new LinkedList();
linkedList.insert(1);
linkedList.insert(2);
linkedList.delete(1);
console.log(linkedList.search(2)); // Output: true
```
